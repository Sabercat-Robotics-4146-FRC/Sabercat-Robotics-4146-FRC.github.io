## Motion

Motion is one of the fundamental concept that must be understood well in order to have a better grasp of more complex processes and concepts.


### Position

#### Coordinates System
Position most notably expressed in cartesian coordinates which are the standard x-y graphs you use in algebra and other math classes. The position of a point is expressed by what we refer to as an *ordered pair* which looks like this: `(x, y)`. It's called an ordered pair because it has a pair (two) of numbers and the order of these numbers is what designates what the number represents. In traditional cartesian coordinates, we put the `x` before the `y` which means when we see an ordered pair like this, `(5, 23)` we know that the number 5 expresses where the number on lies in relation to the `x` axis and 23 represents where the point is in relation to the `y` axis.

### Vectors
Vectors are quantities that have both a magnitude and direction. Visually, vectors are represented by arrows with the direction of the arrow being the vector's direction and the length of the arrow tip to tail is the magnitude of the vector. Examples of vectors and their applications in robotics include: velocity, force, acceleration, or even relative distances.
