## Motion

Motion is one of the fundamental concept that must be understood well in order to have a better grasp of more complex processes and concepts.


### Position

#### Coordinates System
Position most notably expressed in cartesian coordinates which are the standard x-y graphs you use in algebra and other math classes. The position of a point is expressed by what we refer to as an *ordered pair* which looks like this: `(x, y)`. It's called an ordered pair because it has a pair (two) of numbers and the order of these numbers is what designates what the number represents. In traditional cartesian coordinates, we put the `x` before the `y` which means when we see an ordered pair like this, `(5, 23)` we know that the number 5 expresses where the number on lies in relation to the `x` axis and 23 represents where the point is in relation to the `y` axis.
