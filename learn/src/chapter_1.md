# Chapter 1

Chapter 1 covers the principles of design process and iteration. This chapter covers an overview of game strategy analysis. It covers how we have traditionally gone through the prototyping process for the team. How to rapidly prototype leveraging 3D printing and laser cutting technologies. This chapter covers classic engineering drawings and how to effectively communicate ideas visually and verbally. 

## What is Hardware?

Hardware encompasses all of the physical aspects of robotics. This word is used to refer to the team that deals with everything from Solidworks, manufacturing, electrical, all the way down to the literal nuts and bolts. The hardware team is responsible for learning all of the physical aspects of robotics as well as communicating effectively with the software team. Hardware encompasses all of the technician roles as well as design roles on the team. We encourage all of the hardware students to learn as much as they can in the hardware curriculum as well as learn the software portions are they are so closely tied for optimal performance and education.

## Keep an engineering Notebook.

I highly recommend everyone keeps an engineering notebook both on a project level and a personal level. Sabercat Robotics has upheld a tradition of keeping a well maintained and documented Engineering Notebook for each season since 2018. A personal engineering notebook is a good place for you, as a student, to take notes about different physics principles, example walkthroughs, and mechanical design components and assemblies. Really anything that you want to learn and remember should find its way into your notebook one way or another. Engineering notebooks is a form of documentation and all documentation is an **investment**. When you spend your time documenting design decisions, considerations, constraints, and outcomes, you will save orders of magnitude more time and energy in the future. Your personal engineering notebook and an investment for yourself where the dividends are a consistent reference that you will be able to use throughout your career on the team. The seasonal engineering notebook is an investment for yourself, your teammates, and every team member in future years. The engineering notebooks are one of the many ways we try to fight student graduation turnover. Keep an engineering notebook. Document your decisions; it will force you to think through things more.

## Mindset.

Engineering is not easy, especially when starting out. Having a positive attitude and outlook is the most important part of learning. Your character will be tested whenever you work in a team towards a difficult goal. This is your chance to show your yourself and your team that you will circum the adversity of learning and developing an understanding of the world around you. Take pride in your work. Take pride in your learning. Take pride in yourself. Never become complacent. And have fun.

I highly recommend watching the following video's for some good information. The better you understand yourself and how you learn, the more successful you'll be able to learn.
