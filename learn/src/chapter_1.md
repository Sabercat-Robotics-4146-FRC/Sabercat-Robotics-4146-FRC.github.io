# Chapter 1

Chapter 1 covers the principles of design process and iteration. This chapter covers an overview of game strategy analysis. It covers how we have traditionally gone through the prototyping process for the team. How to rapidly prototype leveraging 3D printing and laser cutting technologies. This chapter covers classic engineering drawings and how to effectively communicate ideas visually and verbally. 

## What is Hardware?

Hardware encompasses all of the physical aspects of robotics. This word is used to refer to the team that deals with everything from Solidworks, manufacturing, electrical, all the way down to the literal nuts and bolts. The hardware team is responsible for learning all of the physical aspects of robotics as well as communicating effectively with the software team. Hardware encompasses all of the technician roles as well as design roles on the team. We encourage all of the hardware students to learn as much as they can in the hardware curriculum as well as learn the software portions are they are so closely tied for optimal performance and education.
