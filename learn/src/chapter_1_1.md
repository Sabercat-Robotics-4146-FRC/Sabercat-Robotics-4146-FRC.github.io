## Engineering Drawings

One of the most important aspects of being an engineer, entrepreneur, or student is effective communication. Most roles that you play in your life will require effective communication on some level. The two forms of communication that we focus on in this program is verbal communication and visual communication. 


### Verbal Communication

Verbal communication takes place in the form of speaking and writing. This form of communication is extremely important on all levels, high and low. In the low levels of effective verbal communication, the communicator knows what the correct words to use when referring to different systems and components. Grammar is also an extremely important part of effective verbal communication - if you don't have mastered correct English grammar, it's worth the investment. 

On the technical design side of effective verbal communication, one of the important components is being able to identify the engineering jargon that will be used for efficiency. For example, being able to identify what someone is referring to when they use words like, "bearing", "manipulator", "reduction", "constant", "instantiate", and other words that you may have never heard been used in the context that they will be used by the students and mentors around you. You will naturally be exposed to the key words and concepts that have their own jargon throughout the book. 

*TLDR: Focus on learning the words people use to describe things in engineering and make an effort to have proper grammar. It goes a long way.*

### Visual Communication

Visual communication is what people typically think of when seeing the title `Engineering Drawings`. Visual communication includes all communication that can be seen. This includes but is not limited to engineering drawings, 'napkin' sketches, and even *Computer Aided Design* (CAD) softwares like Solidworks or Fusion 360. 

Beginning with the basics of visual communication, the most important fundamentals are being able to draw precisely and effectively so that others can understand the spacial idea you have. A lot of ideas you have surrounding the mechanisms of the robot, algorithms, and even system diagrams will be more effectively communicated with a drawing than verbal communication. Sometimes its easier for people to see your ideas than hear them.

Although traditional drafting and drawing is on the decline because of the event of CAD softwares, it's still extremely important for engineers to be able to communicate their ideas with engineering drawings. Learning how to draw will also help you learn CAD software and help with spacial reasoning. 


## Technical Drawings

Technical drawings, or drafting, in our circle of use is being able to draw parts and assemblies for any given robotics system. Drawings are broken down into views. As a mental model for drawing views, imagine a part in space. Now imaging the part is fixed in space and you put a glass box around the part. Each face of the box is a view. So only looking at the part through the top pane of the box would be the top view of the box. The back pane of the box would become the back view and so on. These views are only 2D though and require a 3D projection for the engineers to get a full idea of what the part looks like in three dimensional space and not just the 2D projections.
