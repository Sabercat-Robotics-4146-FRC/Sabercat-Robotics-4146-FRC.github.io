## Forward

Welcome to the Sabercat's 4146 hardware guide. This book is not the be all end all for our hardware curriculum. The goal of this book is to serve as a primer to learning the hardware portion of robotics. This book is a resource for our students to be able to learn robotics at their own pace so that we can support and accommodate more students than out mentors are equipped to handle by themselves. As mentors and teachers, we will assist and help the students when they get stuck or have questions. At the same time, it is expected for the students to have the agency to be responsible for their own learning to a degree. The information in this book is fully accessible at all times so that the students can always be progressing through the curriculum at their own pace. Let it be known that this is a work in progress and will likely always be experiencing updates and improvements.

If you have any questions about the content in the book, please email the creator of the hardware book, G Micheal Rowland. [g@gmichaelrowland.com](mailto:g@gmichaelrowland.com)

## Fall 2019 Information

The following calendar is the fall 2019 calendar that dictates the pace of tests for the hardware students. There is a lot of material to cover with a limited amount of time. That said, it's very much worth learning this early so we can have as many students able to contribute when build season comes. We need to move through the math and conceptual stuff as quickly as possible so that we can move into modeling practice with Solidworks.
