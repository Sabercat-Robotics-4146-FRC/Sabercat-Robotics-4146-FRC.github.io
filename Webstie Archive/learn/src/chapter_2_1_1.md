# Mass, Volume, and Density

## Mass

### What is Mass? Why do I care?

Mass is a property of matter that describes how much "stuff" is in an object. Basically, when we say that something is massive, we're expressing that it has a lot of protons and neutrons in it. Although it's not required to understand how the atomic anatomy of materials plays into the mass of those materials, it doesn't hurt to understand what makes up materials. Mass is measured in kilograms in the metric system and in slugs in the imperial system. Slugs aren't used very frequently and we use pounds as a substitute.

There are two defining features of the property of mass.
- The more massive an object, that more it will resist accelerating when a force is applied. This is called *inertia*.
- The mass of an object determines it's gravitational force.

The first point here is one that will be covered more in the section on force, but it's worth noting that when you hear or see the word *inertia* we are referring to mass. Inertia has units of kg (or empirical equivalent, slugs). One way to think of this on a higher level is to imagine throwing a baseball and then throwing a baseball that's made of steel. The steel will require a stronger throw (more force) to accelerate it a fraction of the baseball's acceleration.

The second property of objects with mass being that the mass determines the gravitational force is how we typically interact with mass and that is through *weight*. In the United States a lot of the time when we talk about lbs we are referring to mass even when the units of pounds are actually a unit of force. When we say "I weigh 140lbs" we are saying, "the force exerted on the surface of the earth by gravity when I stand here is 140lbs." Even though this is what we're saying, we usually just use weight and mass interchangeably. This leads us to endorse pounds (lbs) as being a good enough unit of mass (even though it's force) and then tacking on an *'f'* on the end of lbs to designate it as force. So when referring to pounds of force, use *"lbsf"* instead of just "lbs."

## Volume

Volume is a measure of how much space an object occupies or how much space is inside an object, etc. Just as area is a measure of space in two dimensions, volume is a measure for space in three dimensions. The units for volume are cubic inches, and cubic feet in the imperial system and volume has a base si unit of cubic meters.

## Density

Density is a measure of mass per unit of volume. An example unit for density in the metric system in kilograms per cubic meter.
