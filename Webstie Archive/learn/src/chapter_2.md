# Applied Physics: Mechanics

## Why does this matter?

Understanding the physics behind what allows your machine to operate is important. It's important to build a mental model of how the world works so that it becomes easier to design within the parameters set for us by physics. This section focuses on simple Newtonian Physics required to grasp how robotic assemblies function from a first principles perspective. This perspective is useful when taking risks and being creative in your designs. This chapter may feel like a physics or math class, but the content is boiled down to what's directly applicable to robotics. Remember that *math* is one of the most important pillars of all engineering.
