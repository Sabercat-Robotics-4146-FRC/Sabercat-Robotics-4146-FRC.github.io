        <p>We are an educational program out of Saguaro High School that inspires students to specialize in technology, science, finances, math, marketing and engineering, and apply these skills through FRC Robotics. We teach them how to be a leader and
          how to work with a team. We work with businesses, schools and our mentors to create robots to compete and collaborate with the FIRST community.</p>

        <hr class="featurette-divider">
        <p>Arizona has a great Tax Credit program that allows Arizona residents to choose where their own money goes, instead of the state government. With this form of contribution, you lose no money. Tax Credit is not a charity. However, they are a great
          way for an Arizona citizen to make a painless contribution to the community. You contribute money to a particular school club or organization, and then you can claim this “donation” to get credit on your taxes. You get compensated dollar for
          dollar you paid upfront to your taxes as credit.</p>
        <p>Essentially, you're diverting the taxes you'd have to pay, to the state anyways, to a specific school club/organization. As a Arizona citizen, you can contribute up to $200 to a club and have it reimbursed in your taxes. A married couple can contribute
          up to $400. Contributions received from January 1, 2017 thru April 15, 2018 can be claimed on your Arizona State tax return for either 2017 or 2018.</p>

        <h4>Why become a Corporate Sponsor?</h4>
        <p>By donating, you're equipping high school students with how to run a business, how to employ leadership, design, innovate, and solve real-world problems. Your donation could help us register for competition, buy the materials for our robot, provide safe and effective shop equipment, take our students to a world competition and to host competitions for our younger aspiring engineers. As our Robotics members becomes upperclassmen and begin to look for internships, because of your sponsorship, they are more apt to turning to you</p>

<br>
            <h4>What will your sponsorship do?</h4>
            <p>As a supporter of our FRC Sabercat Robotics Team, you are not only allowing us the materials to compete in our competition, you are also providing the safest, most necessary equipment in order to manufacture and program a well-designed robot. When you donate, your company's logo will be featured on our t-shirts, banners, featured on our Robot during competition. Be part of the Sabercat family and show your support for a local, public school educational organization.</p>
<br>

        <h4>What's in it for you?</h4>
        <p>When you become part of our Sabercat family you'll receive several benefits. Your company's logo will featured on our t-shirts, banners, and robot. With this source of advertising, your company will be seen by hundreds of people at competition, and at the many outreach events we organize. You'll also receive updates on important milestones during our season. That way, you will know what your most important money has done to help us.</p>
<br>
        <h4>Sponsoring us through Tax Credit</h4>
        <p>We realize that it's not always feasible to donate as a company, but your employees can help. You as an organization can have your employees use their tax credit for our school club, and still receive the same benefits as a traditional sponsor would. It's a win-win situation! They're going to have to pay taxes anyway, but this way we can use the credit they might not be taking advantage of.</p>
